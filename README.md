# Fastai-Colon-Polyps
Classification of polyps in colonoscopy images using Fastai deep learning

There is a previous version in keras for classification and localization in images of colon polyps: [CNN4Polyp](https://github.com/muntisa/Colonoscopy-polyps-detection-with-CNNs). The current Fastai method is much faster and more accurate. CNN4Polyp is using VGG16 compared with resnet50 used by Fastai notebook.
